# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will have a team meeting on monday each week. Meetings will be about an hour, and will consist of a quick stand-up overview and then time to work together. The meetings will be in person, and we will take notes as necessary. We are also friends and will collaborate outside of specified meeting times.
2. **Assistance** 
Teammates will be able to text each other, and a response should be expected quickly (outside of circumstances like class).
3. **Respect** 
Our team is already close and can be expected to be open with each other if something is wrong.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will use github issues to create and assign tasks. When making these tasks, we will brainstorm the things that need to be done and discuss who is best at doing it.
5. **Time Commitment** 
About two hours a week can be expected of each group member; this may be adjusted depending on how the project seems to be going.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
The team will resolve conflicts by discussing what to do as a group as soon as the issue is presented rather than letting it get worse. We don't anticipate any issues that can't be resolved as they come up.

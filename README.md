## This file should describe the following:

- **Github Organization** – You should describe the physical location of all major files and deliverables (code, tests, data, the written report, the presentation video, etc…)

- **Running Instructions** – You should provide full instructions on how to build and run your executable, including how to define the input data and output location for each method. You should also have instructions on how to build and run your test suite, including a general description on what tests you have created. It is in your best interest to make the instructions (and the running of your executables and tests) as simple and straightforward as possible.
